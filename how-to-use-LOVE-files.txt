These *.love files can be used in 2 ways:

1- Use as an app:
Install LOVE2D from its website and use it to use *.love files as an app.
The "love executable" opens a *.love file to start it.
It works also to open directories, but this should contain a "main.lua" file sourcecode.

2- Use as a sourcecode archive:
Open *.love files like *.zip files and you have the origin of these files
 for editing and other peruse like study or security inspection.
You can extract zips to directories which the "love executable" can start.
